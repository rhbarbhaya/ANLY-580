# Abstract
The goal of this project was to check if age, religion, gender and previous voting preferences has an effect on how "you" vote in Brexit Referendum Vote. Multi-Group CFA was used to test out this theory. After applying those methods on the given data set, we could not come to a conclusion of singling out a particular question variable which might explain the brexit referendum voting outcome.

# Introduction
People of a country were always divided by their political ideas. The division was quite small until a few years ago. To explain in a graphical format. If neural ideas are a center line, the division in question is the difference in current political right to current political left. See the image below for reference [@ghosh_2019]. Pundits warn, if the division continues to grow, it might cause a physical divide in the population. This trend seems to be occurring across the globe [@thomas_carothers_2019]. \
\
The reason for choosing Multi-Group Confirmatory Factor Analysis (MGCFA) is simple, in our lecture we learnt that invariance = equivalence. MGCFA satisfies the conditions mentioned in the lecture. Items act the same across the group. Factor structure is same across groups. Paths are equal across the groups. Latent means are almost equal across the groups. \
\
This project aims to if previous vote, sex, religion and age group give variance in the Brexit voting preference. The central idea is to debunk the theory of "natural" alignment to a political party. Individual of a certain Race/Ethnicity/Age will align with a political party. \

## About the data
The date is provided by **Dr. Erin M. Buchanan, Harrisburg University of Science and Technology** and it's explanation from a study website by Bob Altemeyer, it be found [here](http://www.panojohnson.com/automatons/rwa-scale.xhtml) [@altemeyer_johnson_2020]. The data is a scientific study of where do "you" lie on the Right Wing Authoritarians (RWA) scale [@altemeyer_2006] \

Summary of the data after dropping unused columns.
```{r masterset, warning=FALSE}
library(lavaan)
library(semPlot)
library(knitr)

scoring = function(model){
  round(fitmeasures(model, c("chisq", "df", "cfi", "rmsea", "srmr")),3)
}

master = read.csv("study4.csv", stringsAsFactors = T)
master = master[, c(2,8,9,12,15,16,17,18,19,39:60)]
summary(master)
```

## Remove unknowns/outliers
-   "Remove" column indicates the data points which shouldn't be considered. Those records were recorded within a minute, which is not possible for this survey. \
-   Removing "NoVote" and "Spoil" from "intendReferendumVote" as we are only interested in how they vote. \
-   Reverse coding is not needed for this dataset, it's recorded in the correct order. [@altemeyer_2006] \
-   All the records were in the scale, no check for outliers was necessary. \

```{r cleanerset}
data = subset(master, master$Remove == "Keep")
data = subset(data, data$intendReferendumVote != "Spoil")
data = subset(data, data$intendReferendumVote != "NoVote")
data = droplevels(data)
data$Vote = as.numeric(data$intendReferendumVote)-1
summary(data)
```

# Overall Model
For the theory we want to test, all the question are tied to a variable and that variable will predict the voting preference.
```{r Brexit, echo=FALSE}
brexit.model = '
Q =~ Q1 + Q2 + Q3 + Q4 + Q5 + Q6 + Q7 + Q8 + Q9 + Q10 + Q11 + Q12 + Q13 + Q14 + Q15 + Q16 + Q17 + Q18 + Q19 + Q20 + Q21 + Q22
Vote ~ Q
'
brexit.fit = cfa(model = brexit.model, data = data, meanstructure = T)
semPaths(brexit.fit)
```

# Sex Based Model
Checking to see if Gender has any role on the voting preference. \

## Prepare Data for Gender Based Model
-   Building a one-factor model for this analysis. \
-   There are 2 factors in this model, Male and Female. \

### Female Model 
```{r GenderFemale}
gender.fit.female = cfa(model = brexit.model, data = data[data$sex == "Female",], meanstructure = T)
```

### Male Model
```{r GenderMale}
gender.fit.male = cfa(model = brexit.model, data = data[data$sex == "Male",], meanstructure = T)
```

### Gender Configural Model
```{r GenderConfig}
gender.configural.fit = cfa(model = brexit.model, data = data, meanstructure = T, group = "sex")
```

### Gender Metric Model
```{r GenderMetric}
gender.metric.fit = cfa(model = brexit.model, data = data, meanstructure = T, group = "sex", group.equal = c("loadings"))
```

### Gender Scalar Model
```{r GenderScalar}
gender.scalar.fit = cfa(model = brexit.model, data = data, meanstructure = T, group = "sex", group.equal = c("loadings", "intercepts"))
```

### Gender Strict Model
```{r GenderStrict}
gender.strict.fit = cfa(model = brexit.model, data = data, meanstructure = T, group = "sex", group.equal = c("loadings", "intercepts", "residuals"))
```

### Gender Partial Invariance Model
```{r GenderPartial}
gender_partial_syntax = paste(colnames(data)[10:31], "~~", colnames(data)[10:31])
gender_CFI_list  <- 1:length(gender_partial_syntax)
names(gender_CFI_list) <- gender_partial_syntax

for (i in 1:length(gender_partial_syntax)){
  temp <- cfa(model = brexit.model, 
              data = data,
              meanstructure = TRUE,
              group = "sex",
              group.equal = c("loadings", "intercepts", "residuals"),
              group.partial = gender_partial_syntax[i])
  gender_CFI_list[i] <- fitmeasures(temp, "cfi")
}

gender.partial.fit <- cfa(model = brexit.model, data = data, meanstructure = TRUE, group = "sex", group.equal = c("loadings", "intercepts", "residuals"), group.partial = names(which.max(gender_CFI_list)))
```

### Gender Output Matrix
-   None of them are great predictors of voting patterns, it can be safely concluded that gender doesn't play a role in any apparent pattern in Brexit Referendum Voting preference. \
-   The model for Male was slightly skewed, but not significant enough to determine anything. \
```{r GenderSummary, echo=FALSE}
gender_table_fit = matrix(NA, nrow = 8, ncol = 6)
colnames(gender_table_fit) = c("Model", "X2", "df", "CFI", "RMSEA", "SRMR")
gender_table_fit[1, ] = c("Overall Model", scoring(brexit.fit))
gender_table_fit[2, ] = c("Female Gender Model", scoring(gender.fit.female))
gender_table_fit[3, ] = c("Male Gender Model", scoring(gender.fit.male))
gender_table_fit[4, ] = c("Gender Configural Model", scoring(gender.configural.fit))
gender_table_fit[5, ] = c("Gender Metric Model", scoring(gender.metric.fit))
gender_table_fit[6, ] = c("Gender Scalar Model", scoring(gender.scalar.fit))
gender_table_fit[7, ] = c("Gender Strict Model", scoring(gender.strict.fit))
gender_table_fit[8, ] = c("Gender Partial Invariance Model", scoring(gender.partial.fit))
kable(gender_table_fit, caption = "Gender CFA Model")
```

# Religion Based Model
Checking to see if religion plays a role in voting preference. \

## Preparing Data for Religion
-   There are 5 factors on Religion Column. They are only named as 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. \
-   It was not necessary to figure out the religion names as it doesn't concern the model. \

### Religion(1) Model 
```{r Religion(1)}
rel.one.model = cfa(model = brexit.model, data = data[data$religion == 1,], meanstructure = T)
```

```

### Religion Output Matrix
-   None of them are great predictors of voting patterns, it can be safely concluded that Religion doesn't play a role in any apparent pattern in Brexit Referendum Vote \
-   Results from Religion's 1 and 2 are slightly monotonous but agagin, nothing conclusive. \
```{r ReligionSummary, echo=FALSE}

# Discussion

The brexit referendum vote was almost a 50-50 vote. This model somewhat replicates that. We don't see a clear division. The results are all over the place. The fit measure scores are bad but not terrible, but they aren't good either. \
As is the case with all analysis, more data could have normalized or spread out the variable to get maybe more accurate results. \
